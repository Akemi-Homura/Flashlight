### Ideas
- OpenWeatherMap has multilingual support which could be implemented.
- Present more information such as highs and lows, wind-speed, etc.
- If you choose to open the site, you should directly go to [http://openweathermap.org/city/\{city code\}](http://openweathermap.org/city/2666199) instead of the search results page.
